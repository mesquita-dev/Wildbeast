## üìñ About   

The (**Wildbeast**) website consists of introducing people to the wild world of animals with their proper information.
In this specific interface it is shown about wolves and is more in-depth in this animal branch.
Website made by the **[Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/)** platform using mainly the concepts of **Grid Layout** to carry out the entire project and make it responsive for all adaptable screens.
In addition, the concept of clean code was used in the project and **accessibility** with the issue of image and order for the screen reader.
Check out the website below.
